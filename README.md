# Mask_RCNN
 

Part of the initial effort to understand Mask_RCNN when I tried to use it for my basketball-enhancement web app. This was done years ago so pieces are all over the place. But generally Mask_RCNN, EPQ, and BballWebApp_Draft are all somewhat related working on the same project.

The Mask_RCNN file was downloaded locally, so were a lot of h5 files representing the model in progress. They are too large to be uploaded.
